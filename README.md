#How to open and operate the code

When you open up a code file, I would reccomend copying it into Sublime Text. (Picture 1)
After that, save the file into a new folder. (Picture 2).
It should look like Picture 3 after you save.
Then, drag the respective photos into the folder. (Picture 4).

_In the SecondDraftFolder, disrgared alll the favicon and icon .pngs. just use 3946ABanner.png, footer.png, and TestI.jpg_

Then just double click the html file and the website will open.
_You will not be able to navigate between websites without adding all the respective files to the folder_

#FirstTry.html

This file was my first attempt at creating a website. It is fully html, with no css or style.
There are no photos you need to add to the folder.
This website has nothing to do with the Robotics website section. It's sole purpose was to learn how to code a basic website

#LayoutTest.html

This was my first test in making a Robotics oriented website. As you can see there is only one page despite the appearnance of hyper links. 
Css style is used, but it is super basic. This website was more about learning how to use Css, while also beginning to see a realy website take shape.

#PageTest

Page Test is my first attempt at making a website with multiple pages and tabs. There is a home page as well as tabs for the other teams.
The Css is more complex than the first layout test. Some aspects I am proud of are:

+The horizontal nav bar
+The hover aspect
+My roast on grant in the 3946X page

One thing to note is I mainly updated the home page when it came to Css style and html. 
The best page to refrence in terms of updates for code and complexity is really just the Home page
_I had a copy and paste error in the 3496A file so I would just reccoemnd not opening that one_

#SecondDraft

At this point, I felt fairly confodent with my Css skills, so I decided to make my "second draft" of the website. 
I inteded this one to be my final website to present at the end of the semester, Which it is!
This draft went through many changes over the 2 months I used it. Here are some of the updates I made:
 
+The nav bar used to be under the picture, but I decided to move it to the top, and make it sticky after consultation with some other members. This decison makes the website look a lot more preffesional, and allowed me to create a slim red strip to show what team or page you are on.
+I changed the color scheme of the old websites to match the Kent Denver website
+Putting the Kent Denver photo in the footer was a lot hard than it may seem.
+Lastly, I have been working on integrating a fancy email flyout in the footer.

Some things I would like to work on are:

+Starting to put some real content into the website
+Fixing the email flyout
